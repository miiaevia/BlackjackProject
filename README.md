## BlackJack Project

### Skill Distillery Week 3 Homework

#### Project Description
This program interacts with a user to play BlackJack, providing an automated dealer.
Implemented the following functionality: 
* ability to handle multiple players
* ability for players to choose if they will hit or stand
* ability to calculate soft/hard aces in hand values
* notifies player when they win or lose
* notifies player when they push (tie with dealer)
* logic to differentiate between a BlackJack and non-BlackJack hand with a value of 21


Technologies used:
* Java
* Git
* Github


#### Lessons Learned
* Learned how to implement a for-each loop. 
* Manipulating Array Lists, adding to them and looping through
* Inheritance of different Player types- dealer vs. gambler
* Discussed trade-offs between Abstract Classes and Interfaces with the goal of minimizing code duplication
* Learned that break and return don't break IF statements but they do break loops
* Discussed nested for loops and trade-offs between making them more readable vs. maintaining too many small methods
* Dealt with Concurrent Modification Exception; learned that I can't modifiy a collection while iterating over it with a for-each loop, but I can if I use a for-loop. 
* Learned how to shuffle a Collections class
* Learned about enumeration and how I can use a for-each loop to assign multiple enumerated value types
* All collections have a clear() method. 
* Figured out how to implement new math part-way through for soft ace values 1 and 11
